## Short Research description
### Currently, the plan is to take soil samples from an infected wheat field to test for [P. graminis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymyxa_graminis) and next for [WSSMV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_spindle_streak_mosaic_virus), and compare the different soil characteristics and depths with the quantity of vector and virus

### Research question: How does the quantity of Polymyxa graminis resting spores vary in different depths and characteristics of soil? How do these correlations affect the infectious potential of the soil?
